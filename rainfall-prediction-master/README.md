# India Rainfall Analysis
## Description of India Rainfall Analysis
The value of monsoon forecasting in India is unquestionable.
It is possible to make two kinds of rainfall forecasts.
Predictions over the long term Rainfall can be predicted a few weeks/months ahead of time.
Predict rainfall in remote areas a few days ahead of time with short-term forecasts.<br>
<p>The Indian meteorological department provides the project with the forecasting data it requires.
We would like to concentrate on long-term rainfall forecasting in this project.
The project's primary objective is really to forecast amount of rainfall in a certain region or territory ahead of time.
Utilising historical evidence, we will forecast the downpours which will occur.</p>

## Dataset
We have taken 2 datasets for the Data-Input, Data-Cleaning, Data-Filtering & Prediction.
The Following are the original links for the datasets that have been used.  
(https://data.gov.in/resources/district-rainfall-normal-mm-monthly-seasonal-and-annual-data-period-1951-2000) 
The above is the link for the first dataset and has average rainfall from 1951-2000 for each district, for every month.
(https://data.gov.in/resources/subdivision-wise-rainfall-and-its-departure-1901-2015)) 
The above is the link for the second dataset and has average rainfall for every year from 1901-2015 for each state.

## Methodology
Converting data further into structured sequence for experimenting.
Conduct a comprehensive study of the information to look for variations in precipitation trends.
Ultimately, we differentiate the results into preparation and research in order to determine the annual rainfall. We have used a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques (*SVM*, for eg) to predict things and evaluate them. Using a variety of approaches, we were able to reduce the error.
